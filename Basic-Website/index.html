            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Defining Education</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The definition of education has been explored by theorists from various
                fields.[1][2][3] Many agree that education is a purposeful activity aimed at achieving certain goals,
                which include the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits.[4][1][5] However, there is
                extensive debate regarding its exact nature beyond these general features. Some theorists view education
                primarily as a process that occurs during educational events such as schooling, teaching, and
                learning.[6][7][2] Others perceive it not as a process but as the product resulting from this process,
                emphasizing the mental states and dispositions of educated persons.[6][7][2] Additionally, the term may
                also refer to an academic field that studies the methods, processes, and social institutions involved in
                teaching and learning.[7] The term "education" is derived from the Latin words educare, meaning "bring
                up, rear, educate," primarily related to the mind, and educere, meaning "bring out, lead forth," and
                refers to the bodily level</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
                traits. There are many debates about its precise definition, for example, about which aims it tries to
                achieve. A further issue is whether part of the meaning of education is that the change in the student
                is an improvement. Some researchers stress the role of critical thinking to distinguish education from
                indoctrination. These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education. The
                term can also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people. Additionally, it can mean the
                academic field studying education.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The main field investigating education is called education studies. It
                examines what education is and what aims it has. It also studies how it happens, what effects it has,
                and how to improve it. It has many subfields, like philosophy of education, psychology of education,
                sociology of education, economics of education, and comparative education. It also discusses the history
                of education. In pre-history, education happened informally through oral communication and imitation.
                With the rise of ancient civilizations, writing was invented and the amount of knowledge grew. This
                caused a shift from informal to formal education. Initially, formal education was mainly available to
                elites and religious groups. The invention of the printing press in the 15th century made books more
                widely available. This increased general literacy. Beginning in the 18th and 19th centuries, public
                education became more important. It led to the worldwide process of making primary education available
                to all, free of charge, and compulsory up to a certain age.!</p>
